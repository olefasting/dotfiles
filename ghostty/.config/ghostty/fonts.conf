# All of the configurations behavior adjust various metrics determined by the
# font. The values can be integers (1, -1, etc.) or a percentage (20%, -15%,
# etc.). In each case, the values represent the amount to change the original
# value.
# 
# For example, a value of `1` increases the value by 1; it does not set it to
# literally 1. A value of `20%` increases the value by 20%. And so on.
# 
# There is little to no validation on these values so the wrong values (e.g.
# `-100%`) can cause the terminal to be unusable. Use with caution and reason.
# 
# Some values are clamped to minimum or maximum values. This can make it
# appear that certain values are ignored. For example, many `*-thickness`
# adjustments cannot go below 1px.
# 
# `adjust-cell-height` has some additional behaviors to describe:
# 
#   * The font will be centered vertically in the cell.
# 
#   * The cursor will remain the same size as the font, but may be
#     adjusted separately with `adjust-cursor-height`.
# 
#   * Powerline glyphs will be adjusted along with the cell height so
#     that things like status lines continue to look aligned.
# adjust-cell-width = 

# adjust-cell-height = 
# Distance in pixels or percentage adjustment from the bottom of the cell to the text baseline.
# Increase to move baseline UP, decrease to move baseline DOWN.
# See the notes about adjustments in `adjust-cell-width`.

# Thickness in pixels or percentage adjustment of box drawing characters.
# See the notes about adjustments in `adjust-cell-width`.
# adjust-box-thickness = 

# Height in pixels or percentage adjustment of maximum height for nerd font icons.
# 
# A positive (negative) value will increase (decrease) the maximum icon
# height. This may not affect all icons equally: the effect depends on whether
# the default size of the icon is height-constrained, which in turn depends on
# the aspect ratio of both the icon and your primary font.
# 
# Certain icons designed for box drawing and terminal graphics, such as
# Powerline symbols, are not affected by this option.

# The method to use for calculating the cell width of a grapheme cluster.
# The default value is `unicode` which uses the Unicode standard to determine
# grapheme width. This results in correct grapheme width but may result in
# cursor-desync issues with some programs (such as shells) that may use a
# legacy method such as `wcswidth`.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
# * `legacy` - Use a legacy method to determine grapheme width, such as
#   wcswidth This maximizes compatibility with legacy programs but may result
#   in incorrect grapheme width for certain graphemes such as skin-tone
#   emoji, non-English characters, etc.
# 
#   This is called "legacy" and not something more specific because the
#   behavior is undefined and we want to retain the ability to modify it.
#   For example, we may or may not use libc `wcswidth` now or in the future.
# 
# * `unicode` - Use the Unicode standard to determine grapheme width.
# 
# If a running program explicitly enables terminal mode 2027, then `unicode`
# width will be forced regardless of this configuration. When mode 2027 is
# reset, this configuration will be used again.
# 
# This configuration can be changed at runtime but will not affect existing
# terminals. Only new terminals will use the new configuration.

# FreeType load flags to enable. The format of this is a list of flags to
# enable separated by commas. If you prefix a flag with `no-` then it is
# disabled. If you omit a flag, its default value is used, so you must
# explicitly disable flags you don't want. You can also use `true` or `false`
# to turn all flags on or off.
# 
# This configuration only applies to Ghostty builds that use FreeType.
# This is usually the case only for Linux builds. macOS uses CoreText
# and does not have an equivalent configuration.
# 
# Available flags:
# 
#   * `hinting` - Enable or disable hinting. Enabled by default.
# 
#   * `force-autohint` - Always use the freetype auto-hinter instead of
#     the font's native hinter. Disabled by default.
# 
#   * `monochrome` - Instructs renderer to use 1-bit monochrome rendering.
#     This will disable anti-aliasing, and probably not look very good unless
#     you're using a pixel font. Disabled by default.
# 
#   * `autohint` - Enable the freetype auto-hinter. Enabled by default.
# 
# Example: `hinting`, `no-hinting`, `force-autohint`, `no-force-autohint`
freetype-load-flags = hinting,no-force-autohint,no-monochrome,autohint

# The font families to use.
# 
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
# 
#     ghostty +list-fonts
# 
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
# 
# Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
# Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
# override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
# emoji glyphs.
# 
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
# found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
# different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
# if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
# set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
# use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
# 
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
# italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
# applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
# synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
# as documented below.
# 
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
# 
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
# 
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
# 
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
font-family = "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font"

font-family-bold = "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font"

# The named font style to use for each of the requested terminal font styles.
# This looks up the style based on the font style string advertised by the
# font itself. For example, "Iosevka Heavy" has a style of "Heavy".
# 
# You can also use these fields to completely disable a font style. If you set
# the value of the configuration below to literal `false` then that font style
# will be disabled. If the running program in the terminal requests a disabled
# font style, the regular font style will be used instead.
# 
# These are only valid if its corresponding font-family is also specified. If
# no font-family is specified, then the font-style is ignored unless you're
# disabling the font style.
font-style = default

# Control whether Ghostty should synthesize a style if the requested style is
# not available in the specified font-family.
# 
# Ghostty can synthesize bold, italic, and bold italic styles if the font
# does not have a specific style. For bold, this is done by drawing an
# outline around the glyph of varying thickness. For italic, this is done by
# applying a slant to the glyph. For bold italic, both of these are applied.
# 
# Synthetic styles are not perfect and will generally not look as good
# as a font that has the style natively. However, they are useful to
# provide styled text when the font does not have the style.
# 
# Set this to "false" or "true" to disable or enable synthetic styles
# completely. You can disable specific styles using "no-bold", "no-italic",
# and "no-bold-italic". You can disable multiple styles by separating them
# with a comma. For example, "no-bold,no-italic".
# 
# Available style keys are: `bold`, `italic`, `bold-italic`.
# 
# If synthetic styles are disabled, then the regular style will be used
# instead if the requested style is not available. If the font has the
# requested style, then the font will be used as-is since the style is
# not synthetic.
# 
# Warning: An easy mistake is to disable `bold` or `italic` but not
# `bold-italic`. Disabling only `bold` or `italic` will NOT disable either
# in the `bold-italic` style. If you want to disable `bold-italic`, you must
# explicitly disable it. You cannot partially disable `bold-italic`.
# 
# By default, synthetic styles are enabled.
font-synthetic-style = bold,italic,bold-italic

# Apply a font feature. To enable multiple font features you can repeat
# this multiple times or use a comma-separated list of feature settings.
# 
# The syntax for feature settings is as follows, where `feat` is a feature:
# 
#   * Enable features with e.g. `feat`, `+feat`, `feat on`, `feat=1`.
#   * Disabled features with e.g. `-feat`, `feat off`, `feat=0`.
#   * Set a feature value with e.g. `feat=2`, `feat = 3`, `feat 4`.
#   * Feature names may be wrapped in quotes, meaning this config should be
#     syntactically compatible with the `font-feature-settings` CSS property.
# 
# The syntax is fairly loose, but invalid settings will be silently ignored.
# 
# The font feature will apply to all fonts rendered by Ghostty. A future
# enhancement will allow targeting specific faces.
# 
# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical
# feature name for programming ligatures. To look into what font features
# your font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as
# [fontdrop.info](https://fontdrop.info).
# 
# To generally disable most ligatures, use `-calt, -liga, -dlig`.
# font-feature = 

# Font size in points. This value can be a non-integer and the nearest integer
# pixel size will be selected. If you have a high dpi display where 1pt = 2px
# then you can get an odd numbered pixel size by specifying a half point.
# 
# For example, 13.5pt @ 2px/pt = 27px
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect existing
# terminals that have NOT manually adjusted their font size in some way
# (e.g. increased or decreased the font size). Terminals that have manually
# adjusted their font size will retain their manually adjusted size.
# Otherwise, the font size of existing terminals will be updated on
# reload.
# 
# On Linux with GTK, font size is scaled according to both display-wide and
# text-specific scaling factors, which are often managed by your desktop
# environment (e.g. the GNOME display scale and large text settings).
font-size = 12

# A repeatable configuration to set one or more font variations values for
# a variable font. A variable font is a single font, usually with a filename
# ending in `-VF.ttf` or `-VF.otf` that contains one or more configurable axes
# for things such as weight, slant, etc. Not all fonts support variations;
# only fonts that explicitly state they are variable fonts will work.
# 
# The format of this is `id=value` where `id` is the axis identifier. An axis
# identifier is always a 4 character string, such as `wght`. To get the list
# of supported axes, look at your font documentation or use a font inspection
# tool.
# 
# Invalid ids and values are usually ignored. For example, if a font only
# supports weights from 100 to 700, setting `wght=800` will do nothing (it
# will not be clamped to 700). You must consult your font's documentation to
# see what values are supported.
# 
# Common axes are: `wght` (weight), `slnt` (slant), `ital` (italic), `opsz`
# (optical size), `wdth` (width), `GRAD` (gradient), etc.

# Force one or a range of Unicode codepoints to map to a specific named font.
# This is useful if you want to support special symbols or if you want to use
# specific glyphs that render better for your specific font.
# 
# The syntax is `codepoint=fontname` where `codepoint` is either a single
# codepoint or a range. Codepoints must be specified as full Unicode
# hex values, such as `U+ABCD`. Codepoints ranges are specified as
# `U+ABCD-U+DEFG`. You can specify multiple ranges for the same font separated
# by commas, such as `U+ABCD-U+DEFG,U+1234-U+5678=fontname`. The font name is
# the same value as you would use for `font-family`.
# 
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify multiple
# codepoint mappings.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc.

# Draw fonts with a thicker stroke, if supported.
# This is currently only supported on macOS.

# Locations to break font shaping into multiple runs.
# 
# A "run" is a contiguous segment of text that is shaped together. "Shaping"
# is the process of converting text (codepoints) into glyphs (renderable
# characters). This is how ligatures are formed, among other things.
# For example, if a coding font turns "!=" into a single glyph, then it
# must see "!" and "=" next to each other in a single run. When a run
# is broken, the text is shaped separately. To continue our example, if
# "!" is at the end of one run and "=" is at the start of the next run,
# then the ligature will not be formed.
# 
# Ghostty breaks runs at certain points to improve readability or usability.
# For example, Ghostty by default will break runs under the cursor so that
# text editing can see the individual characters rather than a ligature.
# This configuration lets you configure this behavior.
# 
# Combine values with a comma to set multiple options. Prefix an
# option with "no-" to disable it. Enabling and disabling options
# can be done at the same time.

# Available options:
# 
#   * `cursor` - Break runs under the cursor.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0

# What color space to use when performing alpha blending.
# 
# This affects the appearance of text and of any images with transparency.
# Additionally, custom shaders will receive colors in the configured space.
# 
# On macOS the default is `native`, on all other platforms the default is
# `linear-corrected`.
# 
# Valid values:
# 
# * `native` - Perform alpha blending in the native color space for the OS.
#   On macOS this corresponds to Display P3, and on Linux it's sRGB.
# 
# * `linear` - Perform alpha blending in linear space. This will eliminate
#   the darkening artifacts around the edges of text that are very visible
#   when certain color combinations are used (e.g. red / green), but makes
#   dark text look much thinner than normal and light text much thicker.
#   This is also sometimes known as "gamma correction".
# 
# * `linear-corrected` - Same as `linear`, but with a correction step applied
#   for text that makes it look nearly or completely identical to `native`,
#   but without any of the darkening artifacts.
# 
# Available since: 1.1.0
